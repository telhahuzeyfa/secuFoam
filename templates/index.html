<h1>SECUFOAM</h1>

<p>a technology combining a hand sanitisation machine with the speed-gates commonly used in <br>
    subway stations and airports. When entering a building or entrance with SECUFOAM installed, <br>
    a person will be prompted to use the hand sanitisation machine. This will then trigger the speed-gate <br>
    to open and allow the person to pass through into the public space.Â </p>
